You should not use the ObjectManager directly!

Exception from the rule are:
    in static magic methods like __wakeup, serialize, etc
    in case you should make backward compatibility of constructor
    in global scope, like in fixtures of integration test.
    in class that needs only for creation of object like factory, proxy , etc
